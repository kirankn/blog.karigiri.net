    <p>As I lay on my bed resting and tending to my sore muscles (due to my overzealous participation at the Swachcha Bharat Abhiyaan by Karigiri.net volunteers), the question that kept creeping up was how to ensure that the family that has been brought together continues to stay connected. Without a driving force or a common cause, most associations tend to weaken over time. We have a website in place and communication channels have been set up (Facebook &amp; Whatsapp). If nothing is done, all these will be relegated to just some forwards/funny messages or the Good Mornings/Good Evenings/Happy Festival kinds of messages. These are necessary, but not sufficient to keep the group alive. Vinay and I had discussed a few ideas on how to utilize the FB/Whatsapp groups. Here are a few of those.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Education Guidance - Courses, Scope,</li>
  <li>Career Guidance &amp; Sharing job opportunities - career board</li>
  <li>Health support (Helping meet blood requirements, doctor suggestions etc.)</li>
  <li>Keeping communication lines open (Facebook, Whatsapp, E-mail, Newsletters - Monthly, Website updates, Blog posts by members on topics of common interest etc.)</li>
  <li>Help understand/share information on our culture and traditions.</li>
  <li>Share business opportunities and leads</li>
  <li>Share a common cause – perform social work/community service as a team – education, health, nature - planting trees etc.</li>
  <li>Annual Family Reunions/Get-togethers</li>
  <li>Getting to know one another.. Birthday, Anniversary wishes etc.</li>
  <li>Share photographs from time to time. It will help identify faces and connect them with names.</li>
  <li>Share old memories, Record songs, bhajans from old members.</li>
  <li>Work on business ideas/startup ideas together</li>
  <li>Share good deals, vacation ideas, trip experiences and other referrals</li>
  <li>Know about talented people in our family – musicians, artists etc.</li>
  <li>Share family recipes, after all we are Brahmins !</li>
  <li>Run book reading clubs (remote using Skype)</li>
</ol>

<p>I am sure, you all will have many more ideas to add to this. It would be great to hear those. Not all of these can be taken up simultaneously, but we should start somewhere.</p>

<p>One more point that was raised during the meeting at Devarayanadurga was establishing a “Fund” to enable certain activities. I also tend to agree with Mari dodappa that the moment we have a “fund” in place, along with it comes the headache of using those funds in a way which should be and seem trustworthy as well to one and all. Many a times, when money is involved, it causes a lot of heartburn and affects the entire family negatively. So, we need a model which can enable us to do things well together while reducing/removing the negativity causing issues.</p>

<p>Here’s what I propose:</p>

<p>Individuals come up with “projects” that they wish to lead and make happen. No projects suggestions will be accepted without the willingness of the proposer to lead the effort.</p>

<p>Projects may range from activities such as tidying up a particular location (cleaning, fencing, painting etc.) to helping a relative tide through health/education related issues and/or expenses among other things.</p>

<p>However, to bring the project to reality, it will need more than just the intent. It will generally require money/efforts of people/other resources and overall operational guidance. The most important thing would be garner enough support from people to work with the lead on the project.</p>

<p>We could have an online registry of all such “project ideas” and their timelines. The lead will have to study and plan so as to provide an accurate assessment of the cost involved, people support needed etc.</p>

<p>There may be other people who’d like to spend some money (however large/small be the amount) on such social activities once in a while. It may be to commemorate events such as a loved one’s birthday, anniversaries, remembering elders and the likes. Such contributors may or may not be able to support projects with their physical efforts but would be willing to financially support part or whole of a project.  People contributing to a project may wish to specify their liking among the projects that are in our online project registry, waiting for execution. In such cases, we could help bridge the finances with the execution.</p>

<p>Volunteers may sign up to support a particular project.</p>

<p>As soon as there’s enough support gathered both financially and available volunteers to execute a particular project, we could take up the project.</p>

<p>For every such project, we could assign one of us to be the “Supervisor”. The project lead would be responsible for all purchases and the works while he/she will have to submit proof of all the work done (with receipts where applicable to the assigned supervisor). As a saying goes, locks are there just to keep the honest people, honest. This scheme will enable us to keep the accounts clean and ensure that the benefit of the project reaches the intended target. The team will ensure a detailed accounts of the entire project be kept for viewing by anyone at any time and will ensure absolute transparency. The guiding principle would be to make sure that every rupee of contributed money is spent only on the project.</p>

<p>Open to suggestions for tweaks in this and other potential models for collaboration. What do you people think?</p>

<p>By the way, we need volunteers from the family to pick either one of the above mentioned tasks or something else they wish to champion. Who’s game?</p>
