The first of the "triennial" Karigiri.net reunions held on 23rd May 2016 was an unequivocal success because of everyone who wholeheartedly participated in the event. For a Monday program, the attendance, which well exceeded 250 people, that too at a place 75 kms away from Bengaluru, was truly amazing and nothing short of a first day first show hit movie.

People started trickling in early on Sunday (21st) itself. There were a lot of people who hadn't seen one another ever. Introductions soon resulted in a flow of affection as people started rediscovering their roots and finding interesting people to talk to. It was a true amalgamation of age, experience, knowledge, freshness and energy in one large melting pot. One could clearly see the glimmer of hope and content in the eyes of the seniors to see such strength at display. The young ones were present in great numbers ready to take on the mantle of the family.

To talk about a Brahmin family gathering and to not mention food would be a sin. So, let's get it out of the way. 21st afternoon started a series of sumptuous gastronomic delights. The kempu chutney was the best and was clearly the king of the session, while huli, thili saaru and mosaru anna were quite tasty.  Bajji (menasinakayi + one more) & hot coffee were served at 5 in the evening. Dinner that night consisted of chapatis and the usual rice/huli/saaru. The morning of the event, we had soft idlis, kayi chutney, sambar, pongal plus 'kashi halwa'/'dambrot'. The lunch was extra special consisting of the "Bele Obbattu" + "Bombayi Bonda (aloogedde)" among other things. Delicious kodbales were served during the 3pm meeting. The snack for the evening was the hot "Goli Bajji/Mangaluru Bajji". Dinner was also extra super, though I had almost no appetite left by then. There were arrangements for the morning breakfast as well the next day, which I had to miss. Coffee was present almost all through the day with some tea and juice being served a couple of times.

Accomodation was arranged at a few places including the "main" chatra + Yatri Nivas and a few other places. Sunday evening was well spent visiting the melina betta along with cousins, uncles and other relatives most of whom I had met after a long time. The conversations continued late into the night until we forced ourselves to our rooms to ensure we got up early in the morning.

Around 6.30am on 23rd Monday, the residents of Devarayanadurga were in for a pleasant surprise. The Karigiri.net volunteers took upon themselves to clean up the vicinity of the temple, the garden and the chatra, in the true spirit of Swachch Bharat Abhiyaan. About 25-30 volunteers, young and old, women & men, cleaned up the main road leading to the chatra and decorated it with mesmerizing Rangoli designs.

At 10.30am on 23rd, there were poojes conducted at the temple including "Abhisheka" & the "Utsava" around the garden in the front. Lord Lakshmi Narasimha was welcomed to the "chatra", which was our temporary home, for a special darshana and pooje. All the family members clearly had a swell time on this joyous occasion.

At 3pm, the entire family congregated at the Chatra. The group was addressed by Sri. Lakshminarayana Rao (Mari). He provided an overview of how our family had progressed over the last 8 generations that we are aware of. The elders from 4 of the sub-groups of the Karigirappa family were invited on to the dias and felicitated. It was heartening to hear all these elders speak. More than that, the presence of lots of these elders who made it a point to attend this congregation in spite of their frail health was very inspirational. 

At 5pm, a "family photo" session was conducted near the temple with all of the attendees present. Very soon, we shall be sharing the photographs on our website.

At 7.30pm, Belli Rathotsava was conducted within the temple premises. Many of the family members stayed back for this and the ever tasty prasada (dinner) post that. 

Overall, it was an experience that was inimitable. So many relationships have been rekindled. People can connect names to faces now and hopefully this spark will only flourish. The hope is to keep this enthusiasm growing and we shall have more wonderful things to report when we all meet again in 3 years. May Lord Lakshmi Narasimha bless one and all.
